Took the test on Friday February 14th 2014 and passed it. I now hold all certification (again). Not that it means anything but i like taking those kind of tests to keep myself up-to date and see if i can pass them. This one was probably the hardest one i took between the others, Mainly due to the fact that the 5.5 new study guide has lots of errors in it. But i'm pleased overall of taking it an passing. Since i took 3 before it cost me $125 instead of the regular $195.
