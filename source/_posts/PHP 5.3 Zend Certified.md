Just wanted to let everyone know that i took the new <a href="http://www.zend.com/en/services/certification/" target="_blank">PHP 5.3 Zend Certification</a> and passed it. I did not study as much as i did for the two previous ones but i did read about the new changes in PHP 5.3 and blogged about them as well as you can probably see in my recent blog posts.

<!--more-->I went and ordered my Voucher from the Zend Online Store the other day and took it today Friday Oct 15 at 10:00 GMT +2, Took me about 45 minutes to complete the entire test and once i submitted the results it took the system a second to calculate everything and provide me with the result that i passed.

I was quite in a shock, The questions were a lot harder (at least for me) then the previous two, Maybe it's just because i did not study that hard, But in the questions i was not sure of i just used simple logic. I had lots of questions about the <a href="http://il2.php.net/spl" target="_blank">SPL (Standard PHP Library)</a>, <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.stream.php" target="_blank">Streams</a> (Options), And of course the new <a href="http://php.net/releases/5_3_0.php" target="_blank">PHP 5.3 Features</a> such as <a href="http://il2.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php" target="_blank">Namespaces</a>, <a href="http://php.net/closures" target="_blank">Closures</a>, <a href="http://php.net/lsb" target="_blank">Late static bindin</a>g and pretty much everything i recently blogged about, So it turned out to be a good practice for me.

At the end of the day i'm glad with the way things turned out, One thing i am disappointed about is the fact that Zend increased the exam price (Again) from the usual $125 for PHP 5 to $195 for PHP 5.3. It's amazing i spent over $450 for those tests, Not that i am complaining or anything but i don't see a reason why they have to increase the price for every new exam they release, But that's history.
<div style="direction: ltr; text-align: left;">Overall i spend the following:</div>
<div style="direction: ltr; text-align: left;">PHP 5 - $125</div>
<div style="direction: ltr; text-align: left;">Zend Framework - $160</div>
<div style="direction: ltr; text-align: left;">PHP 5.3 - $195</div>
Total: $480
<div style="direction: ltr; text-align: left;">So once i get my Zend profile updated with the new certification logo i will update my Linkedin profile and my certificates that appear on the sidebar here on my blog. The logo is pretty neat and looks like this:</div>
