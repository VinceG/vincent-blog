"Adjacent is an adjective meaning contiguous, adjoining or abutting. It is commonly used in scientific, specifically mathematical contexts."

This Repository contains a CSV file, PHP Array file and a MYSQL Dump file for all the states that have at least one adjacent state.

This was created due to a recent need for this and since i wasn't able to find a good resource i've decided to create it.
