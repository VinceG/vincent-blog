Latest feature in the Yii E-Commerce platform is the Language Manager. This language manager is similar to the one i've used in Yii Framework CMS, With a few new features. With the current language manger you can:
<ul>
	<li>Create/Update/Delete Languages from the control panel</li>
	<li>Translate strings for each language separately</li>
	<li>Sync between source language and destination language</li>
	<li>Sync all languages</li>
	<li>View only strings requiring translation in a language</li>
	<li>Search for strings in a language</li>
	<li>Set language to be public or private</li>
	<li>See how many strings were translated versus number of total strings available</li>
	<li>Export language as an xml file</li>
	<li>Import language from a previously exported record - you can either update existing ones or skip them when importing. Import will create language if it's not present.</li>
</ul>
See screenshot to get an idea of how this works.
