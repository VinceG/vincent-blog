This past week i've been working on the redesign and performance updates to our company's Support Manager section of our application. The update not only introduced new workflow, design and features, but it also performs a lot better than the previous one.

Some of the new features built in:
<ul>
	<li>Quick Filtering</li>
	<li>Categories, Statuses, Priorities, Assignees, Teams</li>
	<li>Quick Inline Editing</li>
	<li>Multi Moderation (Apply multiple moderation actions in a single click)</li>
	<li>Quick Open/Close Ticket</li>
	<li>Real time view of who currently viewing a ticket from the tickets pipeline</li>
	<li>Full Search capabilities</li>
	<li>Activity Log</li>
	<li>Statistics</li>
	<li>Participants</li>
	<li>Notifications</li>
	<li>Mentions (using @name can tag someone to receive a notification and an email)</li>
	<li>Ticket View:
<ul>
	<li>Quick Close, Open, Close &amp; Next</li>
	<li>Real Time Currently viewing ticket (ajax updates)</li>
	<li>Last Users Viewed</li>
	<li>Multi-Moderation</li>
	<li>Moderation Options</li>
	<li>Pre-Defined templates to select for a response to the client</li>
	<li>Comments</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
Below is an example of how it used to look like vs. how it is now.
